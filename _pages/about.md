With a PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I am a researcher with a profound expertise in developing and applying computational models and methods to understand and design complex chemical systems. My research interests span from molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics to machine learning and data analysis.

In my most recent work as a doctoral student at KTH, I developed multiscale simulation strategies tailored for an accurate description of small and medium-sized conjugated oligothiophene derivatives in complex protein environments. This novel approach enabled me to reveal the binding modes and photophysical properties of aggregate-specific ligands bound to distinct protein aggregate morphotypes, which are potential targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases. I collaborated with leading experimentalists in this field and published multiple papers in high-impact journals. Additionally, I gained experience in designing enantioselective reactions using machine learning techniques as a research assistant at IIT Bombay, where I also obtained my Integrated BScâ€“MSc degree. 

I am passionate about developing theoretical models and computational techniques to address industry-centric challenges across quantitative research, software development, and computational chemistry. My expertise encompasses data-driven insights for strategic decision-making, algorithm design for complex problem-solving, and innovation in computational approaches to pharmaceuticals and materials science. With a focus on efficiency and adaptability, I aim to contribute significantly to technological advancements and strategic outcomes in diverse sectors
